# Testing Automatic Budget Alerts

I've implemented automatic budget alerts that trigger whenever expenses exceed 80% of budget limits. Here's how it works:

## **How It Works Now**

### **‚úÖ Automatic Triggers**
Budget alerts are now automatically sent when:

1. **New Expense Added** - Every time you add a personal expense
2. **Expense Updated** - When you edit an existing expense 
3. **Group Expense Created** - When group expenses are created that affect your budget

### **‚úÖ Smart Alert Logic**
- **80% Threshold**: Alerts sent when spending reaches 80% of budget
- **24-Hour Cooldown**: Won't spam you - only one alert per budget per day
- **Real-time Checking**: Checks immediately after expense creation/update

## **Testing the System**

### **1. Set Up a Test Budget**
1. Go to Budgets page
2. Create a budget with a low amount (e.g., $10)
3. Set the budget period to include today

### **2. Add Expenses to Trigger Alert**
1. Add an expense in that category for $8+ (80% of $10)
2. The system should automatically:
   - Calculate your spending vs budget
   - Send an email alert if threshold exceeded
   - Log the alert in console

### **3. Check Console Logs**
Look for these messages in your development console:
```
Budget check for [Category]: 85.0% used (8.5/10)
üö® Budget Alert: [Category] at 85.0% - sending email to your@email.com
‚úÖ Budget alert email sent for [Category]
```

### **4. Check Your Email**
You should receive a formatted email with:
- Budget exceeded/warning notification
- Current spending vs budget limit
- Percentage used
- Link to view budget details

## **What Changed**

### **Files Modified**
- `src/lib/budgetAlerts.ts` - New utility for checking budget alerts
- `src/app/api/expenses/route.ts` - Auto-check on expense create/update
- `src/lib/groupTransactionSync.ts` - Auto-check on group expenses
- `src/app/api/test-budget-alerts/route.ts` - Test endpoint for debugging

### **Database**
- Added `BudgetNotification` model to track sent alerts
- Prevents duplicate notifications within 24 hours

## **No More Manual Triggers**
- ‚ùå No need to manually click "Test Notifications"
- ‚ùå No need to run cron jobs or scheduled tasks
- ‚úÖ Automatic alerts happen in real-time as you spend money

## **Debugging**
If alerts aren't working:
1. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/test-budget-alerts` to see budget status
2. Check your email settings in `.env`
3. Verify budget dates include current expenses
4. Check browser/server console for error messages

The system is now fully automatic and will alert you the moment your spending crosses budget thresholds!
