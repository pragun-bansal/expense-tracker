# 🔔 Comprehensive Notification System

I've implemented a complete notification system with both **toast notifications** and **in-app notifications** for your expense tracker! Here's everything you need to know:

## ✅ **What's Implemented**

### **🍞 Toast Notifications (Pop-ups)**
- **Real-time toast alerts** appear in the top-right corner
- **Auto-dismiss** after 5-8 seconds (longer for high priority)
- **Action buttons** to navigate directly to relevant pages
- **Color-coded** by priority (red=high, yellow=medium, blue=low)
- **Smooth animations** with slide-in/slide-out effects

### **📱 In-App Notifications**
- **Persistent notifications** stored in database
- **Unread count badge** on notifications icon in sidebar
- **Rich notification metadata** with icons and colors
- **Action URLs** for quick navigation
- **Mark as read** functionality

### **📧 Email + In-App Integration**
- **Dual delivery**: Both email and in-app notifications sent
- **Graceful fallback**: In-app notifications work even if email fails
- **Consistent messaging** across both channels

## 🎯 **Notification Types Implemented**

| Type | Trigger | Toast | In-App | Email |
|------|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Budget Alert** | Expense exceeds 100% of budget | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Budget Warning** | Expense exceeds 80% of budget | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Group Expense Added** | Someone adds expense to your group | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Group Member Added** | Added to a group | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Group Member Removed** | Removed from a group | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Payment Received** | Group payment settlement | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Account Low Balance** | Account balance below threshold | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Automatic Triggers**
1. **Add/Edit Expense** → Checks budget alerts automatically
2. **Create Group Expense** → Notifies all group members
3. **Add Group Member** → Notifies the new member
4. **Account Balance Changes** → Monitors for low balance

### **Real-time Updates**
- **30-second polling** for new notifications
- **Toast notifications** appear immediately for new alerts
- **Unread count** updates in real-time
- **Auto-mark as read** when user clicks notifications

## 🧪 **Testing the System**

### **Test Budget Notifications**
1. Create a budget for $10 in "Food" category
2. Add a $8.50 expense in "Food" category
3. **Expected**: Toast notification + email + in-app notification

### **Test Group Notifications**
1. Create a group with friends
2. Add a group expense
3. **Expected**: Other members get toast + in-app notifications

### **Test Toast System**
1. Watch top-right corner when actions trigger notifications
2. Click action buttons to navigate
3. Notifications auto-dismiss after few seconds

### **Test In-App Notifications**
1. Check sidebar for unread count badge
2. Visit `/notifications` page to see all notifications
3. Mark notifications as read
